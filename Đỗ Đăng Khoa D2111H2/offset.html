                            <p>Kiari Kendrell Cephus (born December 14, 1991), known professionally as Offset, is an American rapper. He rose to prominence as part of the rap group Migos, alongside his cousin Quavo, and his late first cousin Takeoff.<br><br>
							In 2017, Offset released the collaborative album Without Warning, alongside 21 Savage and record producer Metro Boomin. The album spawned the single "Ric Flair Drip", which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He would also appear on Metro Boomin's single "No Complaints" with Drake. In 2018, he was featured on the song "Taste" by Tyga, which marked his first top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 as a soloist, and was later certified 7Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).<br><br>
								
							Offset was featured as a backup dancer in the video for Whatchulookinat by Whitney Houston in 2002. He was 9 years old at the time. A clip of it is shown on the Late Late Show with James Corden in June 2021.<br><br>
							
							The members of Migos were raised middle-class in suburban Gwinnett County, Georgia. In 2008, Offset formed Migos with Quavo and Takeoff. Offset is Quavo's cousin, and Quavo is Takeoff's uncle. The three grew up together in Gwinnett County, a mostly suburban area near Atlanta.

							Migos initially gained recognition following the release of their 2013 single "Versace". In 2015, the trio released their debut studio album Yung Rich Nation. In 2017, their single "Bad and Boujee" became an Internet phenomenon, spawning many memes with the lyrics "rain drop, drop top", which were performed by Offset. The song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, with many critics believing Offset commanded the track. In 2017, the trio released their second studio album, Culture, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.<br><br>
								
							In addition to Migos, Offset has released solo music and collaborated with numerous artists. In June 2017, he was featured on Metro Boomin's single "No Complaints" alongside Drake, which peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in September he joined Macklemore on the song "Willy Wonka", from the album Gemini. Offset would eventually release a collaborative studio album with rapper 21 Savage and record producer Metro Boomin titled, Without Warning. The album was released on October 31, 2017, and debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. It spawned the hit song "Ric Flair Drip", Offset's first solo platinum single, and highest charting US Billboard Hot 100 entry as a lead artist to date. On February 22, 2019, he released his first solo album Father of 4. The album featured the single "Clout", with Cardi B, which peaked at the top 40 of the Hot 100 at number 39<br><br>
								
							Following the release of the fourth Migos album, Culture III in June 2021, Offset was featured on the soundtrack of Fast & Furious 9 on the song "Hit Em Hard" along with Trippie Redd, Kevin Gates, Lil Durk and King Von.<br><br>

In August 2022, Offset announced his second studio album and released two new singles, "54321" and "Code" with Moneybagg Yo, along with the music video featuring model Bella Hadid. Shortly after the release of "54321", Offset filed a lawsuit against his record label Quality Control Music in a dispute over rights to his solo music. His legal team said that he "paid handsomely" for his solo artist rights following the negotiation last year, but now QC has allegedly attempted to claim his latest track as its own.
