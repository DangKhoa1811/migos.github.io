                            <p>Quavious Keyate Marshall (born April 2, 1991), known professionally as Quavo , is an American rapper, singer, and actor. He is best known as the co-founder and former frontman of hip hop group Migos. Quavo is the uncle of late fellow Migos member Takeoff, and cousin of Offset. He is also a partial owner of the FCF Glacier Boyz.<br><br>
							Outside of Migos, Quavo has been featured on several U.S. top 10 hits, including Post Malone's "Congratulations", which was later certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); as well as DJ Khaled's "No Brainer" and "I'm the One", the latter of which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2018, he released his debut solo album Quavo Huncho, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200.<br><br>
							Quavious Keyate Marshall was born on April 2, 1991, in Athens, Georgia. The three members of Migos grew up together in Gwinnett County, a mostly suburban area 30–40 minutes northeast of Atlanta, Georgia.

Quavo attended Berkmar High School and was the starting quarterback of its football team during the 2009 season, his senior year. Berkmar went 1–9 in the 2009 season, and Quavo went 19-of-25 for 201 yards and three touchdowns for the first win of the season. Quavo previously held the record by completing 28 passes in a game back in 2009. Despite finishing the football season for his senior year, Quavo dropped out of Berkmar months before graduation.<br><br>
							Migos was formed in 2008 by Quavo and fellow rappers Takeoff and Offset. The three members are directly related and were raised together by Quavo's mother. Quavo was Takeoff's uncle, and Offset is Quavo's cousin. The group was originally known as Polo Club and is from Lawrenceville, Georgia. They changed their name to "Migos" after deciding Polo Club was too generic. The group released their first full-length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011. They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012.

Migos rose to prominence in 2013 after the release of their single "Versace". The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake, peaking at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Quavo had his first lead single as a solo artist with the song "Champions" featuring several other artists. The song peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100.<br><br>
							
							After the success of Migos' second studio album Culture, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, Quavo was subsequently featured on several popular songs outside of Migos, including "Congratulations", "I'm the One", "Portland" and "No Brainer". In an interview with GQ, Houston-based rapper Travis Scott, with whom Quavo previously worked on the Young Thug collaboration "Pick Up the Phone", revealed he had a collaborative album with Quavo in the works.

In April 2017, Quavo was featured on The Fate of the Furious: The Album on the song "Go Off" with Lil Uzi Vert and Travis Scott. The song was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. Quavo also released "Ice Tray" with Lil Yachty on December 14, 2017. The song peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100.

On December 21, 2017, Quavo announced that he would release Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho with Travis Scott on December 22, 2017 without any prior promotion. The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and had seven tracks chart on the Billboard Hot 100.<br><br>
								
							On January 26, 2018, Migos released Culture II. Following this, Quavo announced an upcoming solo project titled Quavo Huncho to be released on October. It was supported by three singles, "Workin Me", "Lamb Talk" and "Bubble Gum", with "Workin Me" peaking at 52 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Quavo's highest charting single as a solo artist. The album was released on October 12, 2018 through Capitol Records, Motown, and Quality Control Music and features guest appearances from 21 Savage, Drake, Saweetie, Madonna, Cardi B, Lil Baby, Travis Scott, Normani, Davido, and Kid Cudi.<br><br>
								
							On May 18, 2019, Quavo performed "Future" alongside Madonna at the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019.<br><br>

On February 7, 2020, Quavo was featured on the song "Intentions" from Justin Bieber's fifth studio album Changes. The song peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In the following year, Migos released their fourth album, Culture III.
